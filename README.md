# Open Research based on Git Version Control

## Principle

1. If you would like to follow and derive a open research, fork it's git project first, and then modify it. 
2. If you have any new idea, record it, and then commit/push back to your fork repository.
3. Using git clone/fetch/remote/branch as often as possible, avoid the copy&paste operation.
4. If you have to copy&paste, write a comment before and after the copy section.

## Why?

In this way, the invention/contribution of people will keep in the git repository. So we don't have to argue who invent what just like Newton and Leibniz.
